# Todo App Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### Agentic Dev Stack
<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
Follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow: Analyze specs, generate detailed plans, break into granular tasks, implement each task by generating Python code
<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->

### No Manual Coding
<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
No manual coding by humans; all code must be generated by the AI agent
<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### Clean Code Standards
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
Follow clean code principles: PEP 8 compliance, modular design, meaningful variable names, docstrings, error handling, and comments
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### Python Standards
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
Use Python 3.13+ standards. Leverage standard library only—no external dependencies unless specified
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### In-Memory Storage
<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
Use in-memory storage with lists or dictionaries for tasks; no file/DB persistence
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

### Console Interface
Handle console input/output gracefully: Use input() for commands, print() for display

## Feature Requirements
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

Features to implement: Add Task (title, desc, auto-ID), Delete Task (by ID), Update Task (by ID, modify title/desc), View Task List (show ID, title, desc, status [ ]/[x]), Mark as Complete (toggle by ID)
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## Development Workflow
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

When given a spec: Step 1: Analyze Spec - Summarize requirements and identify gaps; Step 2: Generate Plan - Create high-level plan with architecture overview; Step 3: Break into Tasks - Decompose into 5-10 subtasks; Step 4: Implement Tasks - Generate complete, executable Python code snippets
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

All implementations must follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow; Code must be generated by AI without human manual intervention; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with these principles
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
