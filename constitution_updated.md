# Todo App Constitution

## Core Principles

### Agentic Dev Stack
Follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow: Analyze specs, generate detailed plans, break into granular tasks, implement each task by generating Python code.

### No Manual Coding
No manual coding by humans; all code must be generated by the AI agent.

### Clean Code Standards
Follow clean code principles: PEP 8 compliance, modular design, meaningful variable names, docstrings, error handling, and comments.

### Python Standards
Use Python 3.13+ standards. Leverage standard library only—no external dependencies unless specified.

### In-Memory Storage
Use in-memory storage with lists or dictionaries for tasks; no file/DB persistence.

### Console Interface
Handle console input/output gracefully: Use input() for commands, print() for display.

## Feature Requirements

Features to implement: Add Task (title, desc, auto-ID), Delete Task (by ID), Update Task (by ID, modify title/desc), View Task List (show ID, title, desc, status [ ]/[x]), Mark as Complete (toggle by ID).

## Development Workflow

When given a spec:
- Step 1: Analyze Spec - Summarize requirements and identify gaps
- Step 2: Generate Plan - Create high-level plan with architecture overview
- Step 3: Break into Tasks - Decompose into 5-10 subtasks
- Step 4: Implement Tasks - Generate complete, executable Python code snippets

## Governance

All implementations must follow the Agentic Dev Stack workflow; Code must be generated by AI without human manual intervention; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
